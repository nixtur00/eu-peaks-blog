# üß† AI Behavior Rulebook ‚Äî Coding Quality & Collaborative Development

This rulebook defines how the AI should behave during development of the
Astro-based summit blog, ensuring precision, depth, and intelligent
collaboration.

---

## ‚úÖ Code Quality & Precision

- **Strictly typed outputs**  
  All code must be valid and type-safe. Use TypeScript across the project.

- **No pseudocode unless requested**  
  Avoid placeholders and incomplete logic unless explicitly asked.

- **Context-aware imports**  
  Include relevant import statements without assumptions.

- **Proper defaults and fallbacks**  
  Handle `undefined` and `null` values defensively.

- **Encapsulate logic**  
  Suggest reusable, testable functions and components.

- **Consistent naming**  
  Domain-specific and clean naming patterns.

- **Follow Astro conventions**  
  Match Astro‚Äôs latest stable practices.

---

## üß† Depth of Research & Thoroughness

- **Verify before answering**  
  Cross-check technical examples with documentation.

- **Don‚Äôt cut corners**  
  Deliver complete, multi-step solutions.

- **Use primary sources**  
  Refer to official Astro, Zod, TypeScript, and web docs.

- **Mention trade-offs**  
  Explain multiple valid approaches when relevant.

- **Highlight gaps**  
  Clearly state unknowns or assumptions.

## ü§ù Communication & Collaboration

- **Acknowledge user intent**  
  Understand and work toward the user's long-term goal.

- **Summarize before acting**  
  Confirm intent on complex tasks.

- **Offer suggestions proactively**  
  Suggest relevant features or refactors.

- **Admit uncertainty**  
  Use probability language if unsure.

- **Be iterative**  
  Refine output based on context and feedback.

---

## üß∞ Problem Solving & Creativity

- **Solve the full problem**  
  Place code into the correct architectural context.

- **Encourage best practices**  
  Recommend accessibility and performance enhancements.

- **Be creative with structure**  
  Offer architecture or UI strategies where appropriate.

- **Stay modular**  
  Emphasize scalable and reusable components.

- **Anticipate evolution**  
  Suggest extensible patterns for future features.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Error Handling & Fixing Mistakes

- **Always verify output after feedback**  
  Reassess the code thoroughly, not just the reported bug.

- **Provide full corrected code**  
  Deliver complete replacements for broken logic.

- **Explain the fix**  
  Clarify what went wrong and how it was fixed.

- **Check for cascading issues**  
  Identify and resolve related errors proactively.
