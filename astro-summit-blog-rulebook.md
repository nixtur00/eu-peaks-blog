# üèîÔ∏è AI Development Rulebook ‚Äî Astro Summit Blog

This rulebook defines all technical, content, and quality rules an AI system
should follow when building a blog about summiting the highest peaks in EU
countries using Astro.

---

## üß± Structure & Architecture

### Content Organization

- Use Astro
  [Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/).
- Store mountain peak data in `content/peaks/` with a Zod schema.
- Organize content by country or category using folders or frontmatter tags.

### Directory Structure

```
content/
  peaks/
  countries/
public/
  images/
src/
  components/
  layouts/
  pages/
  styles/
  utils/
  data/
```

### Routing

- Use Astro's file-based routing.
- Use dynamic routes for `/peaks/[slug].astro`.

---

## üßº Code Quality

### Type Safety

- Use **TypeScript** across the project.
- Enable `"strict": true` in `tsconfig.json`.
- Validate all content schemas using **Zod**.

### Linting & Formatting

- Enforce **ESLint** with Astro and TypeScript plugins.
- Use **Prettier** for consistent formatting.
- Run `astro check` regularly.

### Component Design

- Isolate UI components in `src/components/`.
- Use typed props and default fallbacks.
- Avoid global logic in presentational components.

---

## üé® Styling & Design System

### CSS Framework

- Use **TailwindCSS** as the primary styling framework.
- Follow mobile-first responsive design principles.
- Use semantic color names and consistent spacing scale.

### Component Styling

- Apply Tailwind classes directly to elements.
- Use `cn()` utility for conditional class merging when needed.
- Support dark mode using Tailwind's `dark:` prefix.
- Maintain consistent typography scale and color palette.

### Design Principles

- Focus on readability and accessibility.
- Use appropriate contrast ratios (WCAG AA compliance).
- Implement consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale.
- Follow a mobile-first responsive approach.

---

## üìù Content Authoring Rules

### Format

- Prefer `.md` or `.mdx` for articles.
- All articles must include frontmatter.

### Required Frontmatter Fields

```yaml

### Peak Information Standards

- Verify elevation data from official sources (national mapping agencies).
- Use precise GPS coordinates (decimal degrees, WGS84).
- Include multiple route options when available.
- Reference official trail markers and waypoints.

### Image Management

- Store images in organized folders: `public/images/[country]/[peak-name]/`.
- Use descriptive filenames: `mont-blanc-summit-view.jpg`.
- Include multiple image sizes for responsive design.
- Maintain image metadata and attribution information.

### External Data Sources

- Link to official park/trail websites.
- Reference weather stations and forecasting services.
- Include emergency contact information for each region.

### Semantic HTML

- Use semantic tags: `<article>`, `<section>`, `<main>`, `<header>`, `<figure>`.

### Accessibility

- All images must have `alt` attributes.
- Ensure full keyboard navigation.
- Maintain contrast ratios and use `aria-*` attributes properly.
- Use proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3, etc.).
- Provide alternative text for maps and interactive elements.

---

## ‚ö° Performance

### Static Generation

- Prefer **SSG** (Static Site Generation).
- Avoid SSR unless essential.

### Image Optimization

- Use Astro's `<Image>` component.
