  <h2><strong>Beginning</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>Everything started calm and neatly organized. We picked up the rented car and I was to be its driver. The trip lasted no more than an hour, but we enjoyed the increasingly breathtaking beauty around us. The views were, from the perspective of a typical islander living near the sea, starkly different. Vegetation also shifted from palm trees and cacti to actual trees and grass. Miraculously, we managed to find a parking spot near the beginning of the trail - trust me, there weren't many. To say this was one of the cleanest, most well-maintained and enjoyable roads I've ever driven on would be an understatement.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="/images/content/content-1752067845664-2qfs17.jpg?t=1752067845674"></p><p><br></p><p>Forecasts seemed to have it wrong from the start, but we still believed that the clouds in the distance would eventually produce some heavy rain or even snowfalls. Undeterred, we pushed the "start" buttons of our watches and began to hike.</p><p><br></p><p>I think vegetation was one of the highlights of the day. Scarce and exotic, yet somehow everywhere. I saw plant species I'd never seen before and would otherwise not pay much attention to. They seemed to defy their existence in certain places.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="/images/content/content-1752067864057-g46t9f.jpg?t=1752067864067"></p><p><br></p><p>Soon enough, lovely blue sky was replaced with thick layers of mist. Wind speed increased, and so did the perception of cold. I put on an additional layer which proved to be a great decision for miles ahead. Even though we were far below 3000, the trail seemed easy even from a beginner's perspective. That was until the fifth kilometer, where we saw some signs, one of which for Altavista refuge.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="/images/content/content-1752067888840-c2sc2h.jpg?t=1752067888863"></p><p><br></p><p>I recorded a lot that day. From start to finish, my GoPro managed to capture at least a hundred separate moments which would otherwise be too difficult to describe pixel by pixel. My phone battery, on the other hand, never died. Behind this success stands just a tiny bit of improvement in my strategy to gear and equipment. Having an external phone charger, two extra cam batteries, and two flexible and practical accessories, allowed me to get the most out of the journey. This time, I was determined to make it into a visual story, reviving my YT channel.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Ascent</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>The ascent began. Up until now, the trail had been mostly flat and unchallenging. A relatively noticeable change was the expansion of the mist and the increasing wind speed. Nothing could be considered extraordinary, but then again, we were hiking in an entirely unknown territory. Not an inch of this place exists at home - yet at times, the "desert" regions reminded me of unpopular Bulgarian spots and mountains.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="/images/content/content-1752068010831-xbujo9.jpg?t=1752068010854"></p><p><br></p><p>The volcanic rocks we were seeing varied in size and shape, but their number didn't surpass the equally impressive scattered vegetation. As elevation increased, we continued to see plants growing in places that defied reason. How did they get water, and how much? Did they need it at all?</p><p><br></p><p>Walking speed was moderate. Having been injured and out of action for almost a month, I started to feel my heart rate increasing much faster than usual. At one point, altitude really kicked in. Once we passed 3000 metres, breaking our own personal records, it seemed as if even the smallest attempt at a harder effort took twice as much to achieve and sustain. There was no point in rushing as we were expected to get to the permit access zone over an hour earlier than was forecast.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="/images/content/content-1752068042323-5hhszb.jpg?t=1752068042333"></p><p><br></p><p>Speaking of which, weather didn't get worse. Conditions remained more or less the same. The Altavista refuge was a notable highlight, even though we knew it was closed for visitors. Interestingly, the smaller house right next to the main building had its door open. Toursists could get in and stay for the night. We used this point for a quick physical, mental and technological recharge. I changed a GoPro battery and attached my phone to the chest strap, making it part of the first-person "shooting process".</p><p><br></p><p>A couple hundred meters worth of elevation later and the sky suddenly appeared. Just like that, sunshine pierced through the mist and blue completely devoured grey. It wasn't difficult to breathe, but the faster heart rate showed us who's boss. In the distance, much closer than expected, was Mount Teide.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="/images/content/content-1752068603720-xl7e6a.jpg?t=1752068603734"></p><h2><strong>Summit</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>Summit. This word was starting to materialize right before our eyes. The journey was far from over, but it seemed as if the hardest part was behind us.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a distinct feeling of optimism and freedom in the cold air. Any remaining doubts about the weather conditions began to fade away as we approached the lift station. If most of the forecasts were to be correct, there would be an apocalypse - rain, snow, or anything in between, accompanied by strong winds. However, none of this was going to happen. The clear blue sky was in stark contrast to what we secretly feared and expected. My hiking buddy even decided to remove her top layer and walk as if she was having a beach day. Of course, breathing remained relatively more difficult than we were used to, and the sun provided warmth that was, at best, deceptive.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="/images/content/content-1752068675734-7pt8bf.jpg?t=1752068675751"></p><p><br></p><p>People who paid to skip the tough part and ascend Mount Teide still had to go through a permit checkpoint. This was perhaps the trickiest part of our logistics and planning, but it cost us nothing more than an urgent two-months-in-advance time management. In order to get to the actual peak, you have to register on the Spanish government's website. Free of charge, this process takes you to an application form where you have to provide some personal details and choose a date and time for ascent.</p><p><br></p><p>Understandably, we had our worries about the future - anything could happen and we could unexpectedly lose our booked slot. But the government's goal is to preserve the national park's heritage and significance by reducing the number of people allowed to climb it. This limitation makes sense, is relaxed and easy to respect, as long as you take action early enough.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="/images/content/content-1752068879523-foqan.jpg?t=1752068879543"></p><p><br></p><p>Showing the printed list and our IDs to the guard, we were let into the restricted zone earlier than our most hopeful expectations. Going through the latest tricky segment where breathing required even more effort and views were otherworldly, we eventually reached the Teide. A smell of sulphur, victory and triumph filled our souls. The target had been reached.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="/images/content/content-1752068908304-y2wl9k.jpg?t=1752068908322"></p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Descent</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>Even though the smell of sulphur was increasingly invading our breathing space, remaining at the summit of Mount Teide felt less uncomfortable than previously imagined. I expected to be struggling with sharp coldness, changing weather conditions and other potentially exotic challenges. Instead, we were offered a clear blue sky, a little bit of wind, and the volcano's authentic way of making people go away. Still, it was a moment to be cherished. Despite flags being absent, we knew exactly where we were. This was the fourth European peak my hiking buddy had ticked off her list. Coincidentally - mine as well.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="/images/content/content-1752068321672-q0r9b.jpg?t=1752068321691"></p><p><br></p><p>We chatted with other climbers and tried to enjoy where we were despite the light dizziness caused by the sulphuric smell. Once enough photographs had been taken, the descent began. As we were making steps towards lower altitude, spectacular views continued to surround from all sides. Clouds appeared to be so far below, we actually thought the initial bad weather forecasts were for the lower mountain areas.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>After a short victory break near the lift station, it was time for me to ask the most important question: <strong>What's next?</strong> I mean, we'd just gone through a 3700-metre peak, of course we had to be planning for a future destination! The answer I got is subject to change and will remain a highly classified secret.</p><p><br></p><p>The only notable thing about the descent was how different the lower Teide area looked. There wasn't any fog this time, so it seemed as if we were walking on another trail. Vast expanses of land uncovered, and distant peaks and shapes stood magnificent from left to right.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="/images/content/content-1752068422372-hj7dmt.jpg?t=1752068422407"></p><p><br></p><p>Near the end, physical discomfort and tediousness were present. One of us was mentally exhausted while the other complained about their shoes. Once we hit the road and got to our car, the adventure was over. We survived! There wasn't a sweeter way to celebrate what we did than returning to the warm and loving town of Los Cristianos, where we had an amazing dinner and opened up a bottle of champagne on the beach. This was one of those days I'll never forget.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="/images/content/content-1752069033867-u4a8p9.jpeg?t=1752069033882"></p>
